# Description:
#   The configuration file for training the NN model to detect three classes of objects:
#     1. Cls_Obj_Front_Side
#     2. Cls_Obj_Back_Side
#     3. Cls_Obj_Front_Side_Defect
#   The dataset is organized into training, validation, and testing partitions.

# The absolute path to the main directory of the dataset.
#path: 'C:/Projects/Synth_Eye/Data/Dataset_v2'
path: /Users/rparak/Desktop/Synth_Eye/Data/Dataset_v2

# Paths to the specific partitions (train, validation, test) that contain the dataset images and labels.
train: 'images/train'
val: 'images/valid'
test: 'images/test'

# Parameters:
#   The total number of classes in the dataset.
nc: 3

# List of class names.
