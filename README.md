# TODO

- add dataset template structure to the main tree of the repo.
- gen_synthetic_data.py - remove time.sleep(10)
- gen_synthetic_data.py - remove time.sleep(10)
- delete/rewrite the .txt label file if, according to the index, the file already exists (currently, bb is written on the next line and the old label remains in the file)
